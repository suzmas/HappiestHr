# README

This app will be similar to Yelp- but for finding Happy Hours.

I'll be using:

* Ruby version 2.4.0

* Rails version 5.0.1

* Geocoder & Gmaps to locate happy hours near user designated locations

* Devise & Omniauth for authentication

* Cancancan & Rolify for authorization

* Happy Hour search using textacular
